# Product Requirements Document: AI-Powered Recipe Generation

## Overview and Purpose

### Feature Description
Implement an AI-powered recipe generation feature that analyzes the user's pantry inventory and preferences, then produces customized recipes and a consolidated shopping list for missing ingredients. Leverage the existing `recipe-generator.txt` system prompt to interface with an LLM (e.g., OpenAI API) in the Worker backend.

### Problem Statement
Users currently browse and manage recipes manually; they lack a dynamic way to create new dishes based on what they already have. Manually searching for recipes and cross-referencing ingredients is time-consuming and prone to waste.

### Goals and Objectives
- Provide users with up to N generated recipes tailored to their inventory and culinary preferences.
- Automatically identify missing ingredients and produce a shopping list.
- Deliver results in under 10 seconds, with clear loading and error states.
- Ensure prompt template (`recipe-generator.txt`) is applied consistently in all requests to the LLM.

### Target Audience
Home cooks and meal planners who wish to reduce food waste, explore new recipes, and streamline grocery shopping by using existing pantry items.

## User Stories and Personas

**Persona 1: Home Cook Hannah**
- Role: Busy parent cooking nightly meals
- Motivation: Use on-hand ingredients and minimize grocery trips
- Pain points: Frequently missing key ingredients or recipes don’t match pantry

**Persona 2: Health-Conscious Sam**
- Role: Fitness enthusiast tracking macros
- Motivation: Generate protein-focused recipes based on inventory
- Pain points: Manually calculating ingredient substitutions and shopping lists

### User Stories
1. As a home cook, I want to select my pantry inventory and preferences so that I can generate relevant recipe ideas.
2. As a user, I want to see a list of generated recipes with ingredients and instructions so that I can choose which to cook.
3. As a user, I want a shopping list of missing items so that I can purchase everything at once.
4. As a returning user, I want my past generated recipes saved (future scope) so that I can revisit them.

## Functional Requirements

#### Requirement 1: Recipe Generation Endpoint
- **Description:** Create `POST /api/recipes/generate` that accepts user preferences (`max_recipes`, dietary constraints, cuisine style) and reads inventory from D1.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] Endpoint invokes LLM with `recipe-generator.txt` prompt, injecting inventory and preferences.
  - [ ] Returns JSON with `recipes: Recipe[]` and `shopping_list: string[]`.
  - [ ] Handles LLM errors and timeouts gracefully with HTTP 5xx and error message.

#### Requirement 2: Front-End UI Flow
- **Description:** Add a “Generate Recipes” page in the React app with: a preference form, generate button, results view.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] Users can input preferences (e.g., max recipes, cuisine type).
  - [ ] Clicking “Generate” shows loading indicator.
  - [ ] Displays each recipe with name, ingredients list, instructions.
  - [ ] Displays consolidated shopping list for missing items.
  - [ ] Error state shows retry option.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- API should respond within 10s under nominal load.
### Security
- Store LLM API keys in Wrangler secrets.
- Validate and sanitize preferences input to prevent injection.
### Compatibility
- Ensure feature works in modern browsers; reuse existing React components.
### Accessibility
- Follow WCAG for form inputs, buttons, and result presentation.

## UI/UX Specifications

### User Interface
- New route `/recipes/generate` in React router.
- Preference form: numeric input for `max_recipes`, optional text fields for dietary/cuisine notes.
- Results area: collapsible recipe cards, shopping list panel.

## Technical Considerations

### System Architecture
- Extend Hono Worker to include a new controller invoking the OpenAI API.
- Leverage existing D1 binding to fetch inventory inside the Worker.

### API Requirements
1. `POST /api/recipes/generate`
   - Request body: `{ preferences: object, max_recipes: number }`
   - Response: `{ recipes: Recipe[], shopping_list: string[] }`

### Data Requirements
- No new persistent DB tables; generated recipes are transient in first iteration.

### Dependencies
- `openai` or similar SDK in Worker bundle
- Wrangler secret `OPENAI_API_KEY`

## Success Metrics
- Number of recipe generations per week → baseline 10/week after launch
- User engagement: click-through on generated recipes ≥ 50%
- API error rate < 1%

## Implementation Plan

**Phase 1:**
- [ ] Backend: add LLM client, endpoint, integrate prompt
- [ ] Frontend: form UI, API call, loading/error states

**Phase 2:**
- [ ] Persist generated recipes (D1 table)
- [ ] History view for users

## Out of Scope
- User-authentication and per-user recipe history (Phase 1)
- Customization of recipe formatting

## Assumptions and Risks

### Assumptions
- Inventory data in D1 is up-to-date and accurate.
- LLM can handle prompt size within Workers’ execution limits.

### Risks
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| LLM latency/costs | Medium | Medium | Limit max_recipes, cache results |
| Prompt size too large for Worker | High | Low | Summarize inventory before sending |
