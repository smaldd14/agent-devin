# Product Requirements Document: AI Agent Chat Interface

## Overview and Purpose

### Feature Description
An intelligent chat interface that enables users to interact with the kitchen management application through natural language commands. The AI agent will understand user requests, process them, and execute actions on the backend such as adding items to inventory, retrieving recipe information, or creating shopping lists.

### Problem Statement
Currently, users must navigate through multiple screens and forms to perform basic actions like adding inventory items or checking recipes. This creates friction in the user experience, particularly when users are actively cooking or planning meals and need quick access to information or need to make quick updates to their inventory. A natural language interface would allow for faster, more intuitive interactions with the application.

### Goals and Objectives

- **Simplify User Interactions**: Allow users to perform common tasks through natural language commands rather than navigating through multiple screens
- **Reduce Friction**: Make it faster and easier to add items to inventory, check recipes, or create shopping lists
- **Increase Engagement**: Encourage more frequent updates to inventory data by reducing the effort required
- **Enhance User Experience**: Provide a modern, conversational interface that feels responsive and intelligent
- **Maintain Data Integrity**: Ensure database modifications are validated by humans when appropriate

### Target Audience
Home cooks, meal planners, and household managers who want to efficiently manage their kitchen inventory, recipes, and shopping lists without navigating complex UI flows.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Cloudflare Agents Implementation

The AI agent will be implemented using the Cloudflare Agents SDK, which provides the framework for creating intelligent, conversational agents. The agent will:

1. **Process Natural Language with LLMs**:
   ```typescript
   async interpretCommand(command: string) {
     return await this.env.AI.run("@cf/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b", {
       prompt: command
     });
   }
   ```

2. **Maintain State using Embedded SQLite**:
   ```typescript
   // Store inventory updates
   async updateInventory(item, quantity, unit) {
     await this.sql`
       INSERT INTO inventory_items (item_name, quantity, unit)
       VALUES (${item}, ${quantity}, ${unit})
       ON CONFLICT (item_name) DO UPDATE
       SET quantity = quantity + ${quantity}
     `;
   }
   ```

3. **Define Agent Tools**:
   Tools will be defined for specific functions like:
   - `checkInventory`: Check if items exist in inventory (read-only)
   - `findRecipe`: Search for recipes (read-only)
   - `checkIngredients`: Check if all ingredients for a recipe are available (read-only)
   - `proposeInventoryAdd`: Propose adding items to inventory (requires confirmation)
   - `proposeInventoryUpdate`: Propose updating inventory items (requires confirmation)
   - `proposeShoppingListCreate`: Propose creating a shopping list (requires confirmation)

4. **Implement Human-in-the-Loop Confirmation**:
   ```typescript
   async proposeInventoryAdd(item, quantity, unit) {
     // Create a pending change
     const pendingChangeId = crypto.randomUUID();
     
     // Store the proposed change
     await this.sql`
       INSERT INTO pending_changes (id, type, item, quantity, unit, status)
       VALUES (${pendingChangeId}, 'inventory_add', ${item}, ${quantity}, ${unit}, 'pending')
     `;
     
     // Return the pending change ID and details for user confirmation
     return {
       pendingChangeId,
       change: {
         type: 'inventory_add',
         item,
         quantity,
         unit
       }
     };
   }
   
   async executeConfirmedChange(pendingChangeId) {
     // Retrieve the pending change
     const change = await this.sql`
       SELECT * FROM pending_changes WHERE id = ${pendingChangeId} AND status = 'pending'
     `.first();
     
     if (!change) {
       throw new Error('Pending change not found or already processed');
     }
     
     // Execute the change based on type
     if (change.type === 'inventory_add') {
       await this.updateInventory(change.item, change.quantity, change.unit);
     }
     
     // Mark the change as completed
     await this.sql`
       UPDATE pending_changes SET status = 'completed' WHERE id = ${pendingChangeId}
     `;
     
     return { success: true };
   }
   ```

5. **Handle Conversations**:
   The agent will maintain context through a conversation using the state management capabilities of Cloudflare Agents.

### Frontend Integration

The chat interface will be integrated into the existing React application:

```tsx
import { useAgent, useAgentConnection } from 'agents/react';

function ChatInterface() {
  const agent = useAgent('kitchen-agent');
  const { messages, sendMessage, status } = useAgentConnection(agent);
  const [pendingChanges, setPendingChanges] = useState([]);
  
  // Handle confirmation of changes
  const handleConfirm = async (pendingChangeId) => {
    await agent.executeConfirmedChange(pendingChangeId);
    setPendingChanges(prevChanges => 
      prevChanges.filter(change => change.id !== pendingChangeId)
    );
  };
  
  // Extract pending changes from agent messages
  useEffect(() => {
    const changes = messages
      .filter(msg => msg.type === 'pendingChange')
      .map(msg => msg.pendingChange);
    
    setPendingChanges(changes);
  }, [messages]);
  
  return (
    <div className="chat-container">
      <div className="messages">
        {messages.map((msg) => (
          <ChatMessage key={msg.id} message={msg} />
        ))}
      </div>
      
      {/* Display pending changes that need confirmation */}
      {pendingChanges.length > 0 && (
        <div className="pending-changes">
          {pendingChanges.map(change => (
            <ConfirmationCard
              key={change.id}
              change={change}
              onConfirm={() => handleConfirm(change.id)}
              onReject={() => handleReject(change.id)}
            />
          ))}
        </div>
      )}
      
      <div className="input-area">
        <input 
          type="text" 
          value={input} 
          onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)} 
        />
        <button onClick={() => sendMessage(input)}>Send</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

// Component to display a confirmation card for changes
function ConfirmationCard({ change, onConfirm, onReject }) {
  return (
    <div className="confirmation-card">
      <h4>Please confirm this action:</h4>
      <div className="change-details">
        {change.type === 'inventory_add' && (
          <p>Add {change.quantity} {change.unit} of {change.item} to inventory</p>
        )}
        {/* Add other change types here */}
      </div>
      <div className="actions">
        <button onClick={onConfirm} className="confirm-button">Confirm</button>
        <button onClick={onReject} className="reject-button">Reject</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
